## Hobbies & Interests

Outside of work, I’m most energized by activities that combine movement, curiosity, and community.

## 🚴 Cycling & Mechanics
I’m deeply involved in the Boulder cycling community and volunteer regularly at **Community Cycles**, a nonprofit focused on sustainable transportation and access to bikes.

I help:
- Teach repair and maintenance classes
- Build and refurbish bikes for community programs
- Support youth and adult Earn-A-Bike initiatives

I enjoy the problem-solving side of bike mechanics just as much as the teaching and mentorship aspect.

## 🧗‍♂️ Climbing & Mountain Sports
I’m an avid climber, mountain biker and lifelong outdoor enthusiast. I’m drawn to sports that require:
- Technical precision
- Risk assessment
- Patience and iteration

Those same traits show up in how I approach systems, projects, and leadership.

## 🏋️ Strength Training
I train consistently in compound lifts and strength development, with a focus on long-term progression and discipline.

I’m a member of the **1,000 lb club**, where the combined total of the squat, deadlift, and bench press exceeds 1,000 pounds, and I’m currently working toward the **1,250 lb club**.

What I enjoy most about strength training is the process:
- incremental progress over time
- tracking performance and recovery
- respecting limits while steadily pushing them

It’s a mindset that mirrors how I approach complex systems and long-term projects.


## 📚 Learning & Curiosity
I genuinely enjoy learning — whether that’s:
- Exploring new project management frameworks
- Experimenting with automation or AI tooling
- Reading about psychology, leadership, or systems thinking

I’m most fulfilled when I’m building or improving something, even if it’s just for the sake of understanding how it works.

## 🤝 Community & Service
Volunteering is a consistent part of my life, not a side note. I’m motivated by work (and hobbies) that have a tangible, positive impact on people and communities.
