# My Values

These are the ideas that guide the way I work, learn, and collaborate.

---

## 🧩 Systems Thinking  
Whether mechanical, organizational, or digital, I’m drawn to understanding how things fit together. Most problems aren’t “one thing”, they’re interactions between many things. I like solving those.

---

## 🛠️ Craftsmanship  
I believe in building things that last: clean processes, reliable automations, accurate data, and thoughtful workflows. Good systems make work easier for everyone.

---

## 🔍 Clarity  
Ambiguity creates waste. I value transparency, clear communication, and shared understanding.
---

## 🌱 Continuous Learning  
Returning to college later in life taught me the value of curiosity and adaptability. I think too many people view learning as a burden, when I think it's my greatest strength. I believe a general motivation to continually learn and improve is one of the greatest strengths one can.
---

## 🤝 Kindness, Integrity & Service
I firmly believe that being a good person requires a deliberate, concentrated effort. This is why I make dedicated efforts to regularly volunteer and giveback in my community.
