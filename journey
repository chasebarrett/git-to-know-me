# My Journey

I grew up in Central California as the youngest of three where my parents owned a small business. As a child, I was a runner, a Silver-Gloves boxer, and an obsessive reader. Particularly my mothers old college textbooks! Those early experiences in the Californian Heartland taught a lot about discipline, the importance of staying curious, and a sense of self-reliance that stayed with me.

After graduating from high school early, I drifted around for a bit before moving to San Diego, where I spent the next decade working in various sales, inventory management, and marketing roles — initially experiential, then digital, and always fast-paced. My career didn’t follow a traditional path; instead of going straight to college, I worked first. When I eventually returned to finish my degree in my late twenties, I graduated summa cum laude from San Diego State University with a B.S. in Integrated Marketing Communications and a minor in Women’s Studies.

It wasn’t the order I expected, but I’m grateful for it. Working first and studying second gave both experiences more meaning, more context, and more urgency.

In early 2022, I moved to Boulder, Colorado to join SmartEtailing as the manager of their product catalog team where I oversaw all product-data enrichment and product-data governance. During my time there, I led their migration from a legacy PIM to Akeneo. It was a large, complicated project spanning development, data governance, and cross-functional alignment, and we delivered it several months ahead of schedule, saving roughly $400,000 in development cost. It remains one of the projects I’m most proud of.

In May 2023, I was part of a round of layoffs. After taking some time to reset and volunteer in the community, I joined SCARPA North America as their Ecommerce Specialist. My work there bridges technical systems, data structures, and operational workflows, supporting direct-to-consumer channels and helping the business scale responsibly. It’s work that lives at the intersection of process, technology, and people, which is exactly where I like to be.

Across every role, I’ve been pulled toward solving system-level problems: messy data, broken handoffs, integration failures, unclear processes, or anything that makes work harder than it needs to be. I love taking something tangled and turning it into something stable, simple, and reliable.

I’m always learning, whether through PMI (Project Management Institute) workshops studies, Python experimentation, and keeping an eye on how AI-mediated tooling is reshaping operations, content, and decision-making. I’m energized by industries in transition, teams in growth phases, and organizations that value clarity and continuous improvement.

Outside of work, I stay involved in the Boulder community through volunteer mechanic work at Community Cycles and occasional pro bono design and web support for various nonprofits. These projects keep me grounded, connected, and inspired.

Thanks for reading! Always happy to connect or talk about systems, bikes, eCommerce, or whatever you’re building next.
